# Definition
**Depth-first search** (**DFS**) is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") for traversing or searching [[Tree]] or [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure) "Graph (data structure)") data structures. The algorithm starts at the [[Tree#Node|root node]](selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
