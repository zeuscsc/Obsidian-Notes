# Definition
**Minimax** (sometimes **MinMax**, **MM** or **saddle point**)is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.

# Example
Suppose the game being played only has a maximum of two possible moves per player each turn. The algorithm generates the [[Tree]] on the right, where the circles represent the moves of the player running the algorithm (_maximizing player_), and squares represent the moves of the opponent (_minimizing player_). Because of the limitation of computation resources, as explained above, the [[tree]] is limited to a _look-ahead_ of 4 moves.

The algorithm evaluates each [[Tree#Node|leaf node]] using a heuristic evaluation function, obtaining the values shown. The moves where the maximizing player wins are assigned with positive infinity, while the moves that lead to a win of the minimizing player are assigned with negative infinity. At level 3, the algorithm will choose, for each node, the smallest of the child node values, and assign it to that same node (e.g. the node on the left will choose the minimum between "10" and "+∞", therefore assigning the value "10" to itself). The next step, in level 2, consists of choosing for each node the largest of the child node values. Once again, the values are assigned to each parent node. The algorithm continues evaluating the maximum and minimum values of the child nodes alternately until it reaches the root node, where it chooses the move with the largest value (represented in the figure with a blue arrow). This is the move that the player should make in order to minimize the maximum possible loss.
