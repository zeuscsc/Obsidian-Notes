## Definition
In [[cryptography]], a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.
In 2012, Silvio Micali(the inventor of zero-knowledge proof) received the Turing Award for his work in [[cryptography]].

## Examples
Two balls and the colour-blind friend

To get a 99% confident, all you need to do is to repeat 7 times(99.91% for 10 times).

## Types of [[Zero Knowledge Proof]]
	Interactive
	Non-Interactive
While balls switching is interactive proof, non-interactive proof is even better.

## Application on [[Blockchain]]
One of the big problem for [[bitcoin]] is it's privacy is non existent.  It is because all transactions data is available publicly so that all others can check if it is a valid.  The good thing about [[bitcoin]] is it is safe and decentralized.  But the down side is also everyone know what you traded.

[[Zcash]] is one of the cypto that uses [[Zero Knowledge Proof]].
