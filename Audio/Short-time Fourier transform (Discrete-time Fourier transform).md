### Wiki
The **Short-time Fourier transform** (**STFT**), is a [Fourier-related transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fourier-related_transforms "List of Fourier-related transforms") used to determine the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time.

In practice, the procedure for computing STFTs is to divide a longer time signal into shorter segments of equal length and then compute the Fourier transform separately on each shorter segment. This reveals the Fourier spectrum on each shorter segment. One then usually plots the changing spectra as a function of time, known as a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram "Spectrogram") or waterfall plot, such as commonly used in [Software Defined Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Defined_Radio "Software Defined Radio") (SDR) based spectrum displays. Full bandwidth displays covering the whole range of an SDR commonly use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) with 2^24 points on desktop computers.

### Real World Problem
In real world, your computer do have infinite amount of storage to store the strength of the singal of a continuous wave, becuase it can always divide in to smaller length (infinite number count between 0-1).  In order to do that, you need to process [[Types of Audio#Digital Audio|Digital Signal]], ![[Pasted image 20220530012347.png]] [[Fourier series]] or [[Fourier transform]] is invented to solve the continuous problem, that's why we can't use that directly on the real world signal processing for digital computers.
