In computer science, a self-balancing binary search [[tree]] (BST) is any node-based binary search [[tree]] that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions. These operations when designed for a self-balancing binary search [[tree]], contain precautionary measures against boundlessly increasing [[tree]] height, so that these abstract data structures receive the attribute "self-balancing".

An example of an unbalanced tree; following the path from the root to a node takes an average of 3.27 node accesses

The same tree after being height-balanced; the average path effort decreased to 3.00 node accesses
