# Definition
**Breadth-first search** (**BFS**) is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") for searching a [[Tree]] data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the [[Tree#Node|tree root]] and explores all nodes at the present [depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)#Terminology "Tree (data structure)") prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(data_structure) "Queue (data structure)"), is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

You can use [[Minimax algorithm]] with [[Breadth-first search]] together with [[Monte Carlo]] to make a chess or turn based AI.
