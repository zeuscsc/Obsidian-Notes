The author mentions that we need an [[audio]] track with the voice we want to clone and recommends using the free software Audacity to edit and export it as a WAV file. Google Colab is another essential tool he introduces, which is used to run the code blocks required for voice cloning.

## Changing AI Settings
The author walks us through the second code block where we can input text for the AI to speak and choose the quality of the output. He also mentions that the more [[audio]] files we upload, the better the AI can learn and produce the desired output.

## Running the Code Blocks
Once the settings are inputted, the author explains that we can run the code blocks top to bottom and upload [[audio]] files as prompted. He then runs the last code block to clone his voice, showcasing the output in the video.
