want, which is to have this kind of realistic rendering that takes into account these different reflection properties. So it's just something to keep in mind that it's not always like a one-to-one representation of the world. There's some approximations happening, but at the end of the day, it still produces a really impressive and realistic render.environment. And so that's what Block Nerf helped with, is it was able to take in all of these camera images from the car, which were taken as the car drove down streets or like, I think they even went inside some buildings. They took all these images in and then used the Nerf system to create a 3D representation of the environment that they drove through. And so now, like if you're doing simulations or whatever it might be, they have access to a really accurate representation of what the environment looks like. And that's what the Block Nerf project was all about.can tell that they are very invested in NERF and pushing the technology forward. And so I do think we're gonna see a lot more advancements in the near future in terms of how we interact with NERF-based models and how we convert them into more traditional 3D models for use in existing tooling. So overall, I think it's a very exciting area. There's a lot of potential for practical applications, as you mentioned with self-driving cars, but also just in terms of creating more realistic and immersive virtual experiences for people. So I'm excited to see where it goes in the next few years.# Introduction

The interviewee talks about the Omniverse and server-based rendering of NERFs. They also discuss the trend of many tool sets migrating to the cloud. 

# Nerf Studio Overview 
![[snapshots/nyi3SVxUjOY/00-40-47.png]]
Nerf Studio is an open-source project that aims to combine a variety of different NERF methods. The project was created to bring together different methods and make them easier to use. The interviewee explains that some projects, including the original Nerf codebase, are no longer being maintained, and it is difficult to know where to start when using NERFs. 

# Making NERF Studio Accessible 
![[snapshots/nyi3SVxUjOY/00-46-25.png]]
Nerf Studio was designed to be an accessible tool. The interviewee explains that it is modular and can be used by both researchers and engineers. They want to make it easy for people to extend the tool and benefit from it. 

# Using Nerf Studio 
To get started with Nerf Studio, a user can visit nerf.studio. As of the time of the interview, there was a guide for installation on the left side of the website. They also suggest that Colab can be used to render NERF models without needing an expensive GPU. The interviewee also notes that they are active on the project's Discord channel, where people can ask questions.

# Live Event 
The interviewer notes that on November 17th, they'll host a live [[computer vision]] decoded event in Durham, North Carolina. They plan to show off NERFs and discuss them. The organizers intend to use Nerf Studio and record 3D workflow to capture someone and initiate a few minutes of training.
