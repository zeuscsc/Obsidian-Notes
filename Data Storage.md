Base on the notes in /Data Storage/ and /Data Storage/Distributed File System/  and /Data Storage/Non Relational [[Database]]/  and /Data Storage/Relational [[Database]]/ , create a summary for Data Storage
Based on your notes, Data Storage can be divided into two main categories: Relational Databases and Non-Relational Databases. Relational Databases use a structured approach to store data, while Non-Relational Databases use a more flexible approach. Within Relational Databases, there are various topics such as Relationsal [[Database]] Management System, [[Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)]], and Normalization. On the other hand, Non-Relational Databases include Distributed File Systems and [[NoSQL]] databases. [[Hadoop Distributed File System]] is a popular example of a Distributed File System, while [[NoSQL]] databases allow for the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in Relational [[Database]] Management Systems.
