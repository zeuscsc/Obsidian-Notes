In [digital image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing "Digital image processing") and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), **image segmentation** is the process of partitioning a [digital image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image "Digital image") into multiple **image segments**, also known as **image regions** or **image objects** ([sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel "Pixel")).

One example I have done before was licence plate image segmentation.
