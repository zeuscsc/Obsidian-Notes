The **histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)** is a [[Visual descriptor|feature descriptor]] used in [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") and [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing "Image processing") for the purpose of [object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection "Object detection").
 The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image. This method is similar to that of [edge orientation histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edge_orientation_histogram&action=edit&redlink=1 "Edge orientation histogram (page does not exist)"), [scale-invariant feature transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform "Scale-invariant feature transform") descriptors, and [shape contexts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_context "Shape context"), but differs in that it is computed on a dense grid of uniformly spaced cells and uses overlapping local contrast normalization for improved accuracy.
