A non-fungible token is a financial security consisting of digital data stored in a [[blockchain]], a form of distributed ledger. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the [[blockchain]], and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded.

Unlike [[Non-fungible token (NFT)|NFT]] [[Fungibility|Fungible]] token are alike currency EG: [[Bitcoin]], it can be trade with known price.  It can exchange just like other currency.

An NFT is a unit of data, stored on a type of digital ledger called a [[blockchain]], which can be sold and traded.

The NFT can be associated with a particular digital or physical asset such as images, art, music, and sport highlights and may confer licensing rights to use the asset for a specified purpose.  An NFT (and, if applicable, the associated license to use, copy, or display the underlying asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets.  The extralegal nature of NFT trading usually results in an informal exchange of ownership over the asset that has no legal basis for enforcement, and so often confers little more than use as a status symbol.
