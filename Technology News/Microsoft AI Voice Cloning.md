# Microsoft AI Voice Cloning
![[snapshots/F6HSsVIkqIU/00-04-18.png]]
## Introduction
- Researchers at Microsoft Research have developed an AI voice cloning system that can clone a voice after listening to a three-second sample.
- The new method is much faster than previous AI voice cloning systems which require 30 minutes of speech samples.

- The AI can preserve emotions and even the ambient environment of the original recordings.

## Methodology

- The AI analyzes the timbre, prosody, and rhythm of the speaker's voice.
- It creates an AI voice clone that can say any text prompt given to it.

- The AI can generate several variants of speech for the same prompt, each with different emphasis on words.
- It can preserve emotions and even ambient environmental noise of the source recording.

## Evaluation

- The new technique was compared to previous techniques using the word error rate metric and similarity of voice with the input sample.
- The new technique had the lowest word error rate and highest similarity score.
