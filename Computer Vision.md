Base on the notes in /Computer Vision/ , create a summary for Computer Vision
Based on your notes, Computer Vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world around us. Visual descriptors or image descriptors are used to describe the visual features of images and videos, including shape, color, texture, and motion. Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments or objects. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for object detection and classification. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used for object detection. General information descriptors cover low-level descriptors such as color, texture, shape, motion, and location, while specific domain information descriptors provide information about objects and events in the scene. Applications of visual descriptors include multimedia document search engines, digital libraries, personalized electronic news services, and content control and filtering.
