# Definition
**Breadth-first search** (**BFS**) is an algorithm for searching a [[Tree]] data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the [[Tree#Node|tree root]] and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

You can use [[Minimax algorithm]] with [[Breadth-first search]] together with [[Monte Carlo]] to make a chess or turn based AI.
