- NVIDIA has created a text-to-video AI that can generate videos up to 5 minutes in length with high resolution.

- It can create videos of natural phenomena, art, graphics, and even self-created characters based on text input.

- The AI can also predict an entire video sequence from just a single image, which is useful for training self-driving cars.

- The secret ingredient of this technique is temporal coherence, which ensures a coherent video in the making.
- The AI uses a diffusion-based technique and a proposed temporal video fine-tuning step to create these videos.

- The videos generated by this AI are used by prestigious labs, including OpenAI, Toyota Research, GitHub, etc.

- Weights and Biases is used to create better videos, and it's free for individuals, academics, and open source projects.
