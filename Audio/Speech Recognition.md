Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is the process of converting spoken words into text or commands that a computer can understand and execute. It involves analyzing and interpreting [[audio]] signals to identify the words spoken, and then converting them into written or digital form. Speech recognition technology is used in a variety of applications, including virtual assistants, dictation software, and automated customer service systems.
